Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process that involves designing, creating and maintaining software solutions to digital problems by writing code that serves as instructions for computers. It involves creation of websites and applications (programs) thatare useful in the fulfilment of day-to-day tasks in the modern digital world.

Software engineering is important in the technology industry in many different ways, among them:
1. Making life easier: One of the key principles of software engineering is simplicity. This means that its primary objective is to make interaction with technology devices easier. This makes life easier as tasks can be completed faster and in a more simple way.
2. 

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: Involves understanding and defining the objectives, feasibility and requirements for the software project
Analysis: Involves gathering and documenting the requirements for the software project, including input from prospective users.
Design: Involves creating the architecture and design of the software.
Development: Involves writing the actual code to build the software.
Testing: Involves evaluating the final product of the development phase to identify and fix defects.
Implementation: Involves deployment of the final product after testing and fixing defects.
Maintenance: Involves monitoring the software for issues, performing updates, fixing bugs and making enhancements based on user feedback.

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  Software Developer
Writing, testing, documenting and maintaining the source code of software applications according to specifications
Designing the system architecture and software components.
Identifying and fixing bugs in the software and optimizing the code for maximum performance.
  Quality Assuarance Engineer.
Identifying, documenting and tracking defects and bugs in the code and working with developers to work on them
Developing and executing various types of testing.
Conducting performance testing to ensure the software meets requirements
  Project Manager.
Planning for the prospective project; creating detailed project plans and schedules.
Allocating resources and managing budgets to ensure the team has the necessary tools and support to complete the project.
Tracking project progress, monitoring performance and providing regular updates and reports to stakeholders.

6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  Unit testing.
Involves testing individual components or modules of the software being tested.
This is important in that identifying and fixing bugs at each unit level prevents carrying the problem to other levels, ensuring each part of the code performs optimally.
  Integrating testing.
Involves testing the interactions between the different components or modules of the software so as to identify and fix the issues that may occur when units are combined and communicate with each other.
This is important in that it ensures integrated components work together as intended.
  System testing
Involves testing the whole system, including the integrations, to verify that it performs as intended.
This is important in that it ensures that the entire system functions as intended, meeting the specified requirements.
  Acceptance testing.
Involves testing done by end-users to determine whether the software meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment.
This is important in that it makes sure the software meets clients expectations and specified requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering: This is the process of designing and refining the prompts given to AI models to elicit desired responses.
Importance: It improves response quality of AI; users can guide AI models to generate more precise and relevant answers.

2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt:'Tell me about cars'
Improved prompt:'Tell me about personal vehicles within a budget of ksh 1,000,000 that would be economical in Kenya'
The improved prompt is more effective because it is more specific to the needs of the user, compared to the vague prompt; the vague prompt will give you any information about cars, what they are, probably their origin, etc while the improved prompt will give you information tailored to what you really want to know concerning cars
